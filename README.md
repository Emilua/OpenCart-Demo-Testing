QA Bug Reports Pet Project

Welcome to the QA Bug Reports Pet Project - a collection of structured and well-documented bug reports created while practicing software testing skills. The project focuses on identifying UI and functional issues on the demo website opencart.abstracta.us, using industry‑standard formats suitable for Jira.

Project Goal

To practice professional QA documentation, including:

- Writing clear and concise bug reports
- Using Jira-style structure
- Applying test design techniques such as BVA, equivalence classes, and negative testing
- Maintaining a clean, organized repository of testing artifacts

Contents

This repository includes:

- Bug reports written in Jira format
- Test design examples
- Notes on test scenarios and expected behavior

Bug Reports

Each bug report contains the following sections:

- Summary
- Pre-conditions
- Steps to Reproduce
- Expected Result
- Actual Result

Unfortunately, when opening a PDF directly in GitHub, the YouTube link in the Attachments section is not clickable. However, if you download the PDF file, the link works correctly.
Because of this limitation, I am also including a YouTube link for each bug reproduction directly in the repository.
